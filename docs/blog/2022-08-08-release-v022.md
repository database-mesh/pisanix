Pisanix version 0.2.0 was recently released. The newly released one supports dynamic read/write splitting. More details below.

## Introducing dynamic read/write splitting
### Introduction

Read/write splitting is one of the most commonly used solutions for MySQL's high availability. It improves query performance and reduces server load in practical scenarios. On top of the static rules of v0.1.1, dynamic read/write splitting is added in this release.

Read/write splitting rules need to be configured when it comes to splitting with dynamic awareness. Pisa-Proxy performs SQL routing according to the rules. As shown in Figure 1.1, the Pisa-Proxy backend will start four monitors to sense the backend cluster status. 

Monitor Reconcile will calculate and aggregate the data reported by the Monitor and draw the final state of the backend cluster. Then Monitor Reconcile sends the state information to RulesMatch through the channel. RulesMatch dynamically adjusts the backend data source list once it receives the message.

The concepts included above are: 

- Node: Backend database node.
- RulesMatch: RulesMatch engine matches with the SQL query statements received by Pisa-Proxy based on the written rule set. 
- TargetRole: A TargetRole group matched by the RulesMatch engine. Each TargetRole group may contain one or more nodes.
- LoadBalance: The load balance module selects an appropriate node from the TargetRole group according to the corresponding algorithm.
- TargetInstance: Nodes selected by the LoadBalance module.
- Discovery: Discovery type, which corresponds to the high availability strategy used by the backend data source, such as MHA, RDS, MGR, etc. The newly released version mainly supports MHA.
- Monitor: It refers to the backend detector module of Pisa-Proxy, which mainly relies on four kinds of Monitors in MHA.
  - Connect Monitor: detect database connectivity.
  - Ping Monitor: detect whether the database is healthy.
  - Replication Lag Monitor: detect the latency status of primary-secondary replication. 
  - Read Only Monitor: detect the roles of primary-secondary databases.

### Read/write splitting configuration

The configuration mode of dynamic read/write splitting is the same as that of the static one. The configuration items of dynamic read/write splitting are as follows: 

|Parameter|	Type|	Dependency or not|	Default Value|	Description|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|user|	string|	Yes|	None|	Detector module checks the username of SQL statements.|
|password|	string|	Yes|	None|	Detector module checks the password of SQL statements.|
|monitor_period|	u64|	Yes|	1000|	The period (ms) by which detector module updates and senses the backend data source status.|
|connect_period|	u64|	Yes|	1000|	Connect Monitor detection period (ms)|
|connect_timeout|	u64|	Yes|	6000|	Connect Monitor detection timeout (ms)|
|connect_failure_threshold|	u64|	Yes|	1|	Number of retries when Connect Monitor detection fails|
|ping_period|	u64|	Yes|	1000|	Ping Monitor detection period (ms)|
|ping_timeout|	u64|	Yes|	6000|	Ping Monitor detection timeout (ms)|
|ping_failure_threshold|	u64|	Yes|	1|	Number of retries when Ping Monitor detection fails.|
|replication_lag_period|	u64|	Yes|	1000|	Replication Lag Monitor detection period (ms)|
|replication_lag_timeout|	u64|	Yes|	6000|	Replication Lag Monitor detection timeout (ms)|
|replication_lag_failure_threshold|	u64|	Yes|	1|	Number of retries when Replication Lag Monitor detection fails.|
|max_replication_lag|	u64|	Yes|	10000|	User-defined maximum primary/secondary latency threshold (ms)|
|read_only_period|	u64|	Yes|	1000|	Read Only detection period (ms)|
|read_only_timeout|	u64|	Yes|	6000|	Read Only detection timeout (ms)|
|read_only_failure_threshold|	u64|	Yes|	3|	Number of retries when Read Only Monitor detection fails.|
